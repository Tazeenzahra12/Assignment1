Assignment Description:
Task01: 
I have calculated Volume of sun and Earth and their ratio by using the sphere formula and used math.cal funtion such as Math.pow and Math.PI. I have also given the approx valued for the three values which are printed on console.

Task02: 
I have used the labels for the loops, and for the outer loop I have given it a label Iteration. To save from the multiple testing I have used Math.sqrt funtion in the loop. If the loop is true it will print the prime values otherwise I have used the continue ( label name of outer loop ) to continue the Iteration till the maximum number 50.

Task03:
I have used the IF ELSE loop in this. I converted the text to uppercase and then iterate the loop over the characters then if it finds space in char it will increment spaces, else if , it finds vowels, it will increment that and otherwise increment consonants.+

Task04:
In this I have used split funtionallity through space as a delimiter and then I have used Insertion sort to sort the string. Because we want to sort it alphabetically , I have used the funtion Compareto so that it arrange the string lexographically.
